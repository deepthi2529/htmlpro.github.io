    <p>A History that Became Bengaluru's Favorite since 2006
        Meghana, meaning rain, is a restaurant that was started in the year 2006, at Koramangala, Bengaluru with the intention of serving authentic Andhra style food, using quality ingredients and the pure passion and love for what we do. Since its humble opening a decade back, Meghana is honoured to have spread across five branches in the city and is raring to cover all corners in the years to come. Meghana is proud to be a favourite among all kinds of masses which range from corporate people and college going students in the afternoons to families and singletons at dinner time.</p>>
